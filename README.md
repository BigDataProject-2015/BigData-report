##Handling Big Data: Performance Comparison for MySQL, MongoDB and Redis

The goal of this project is to test various types of storage systems and measure their performance while handling operations on big dataset.

###Dataset
Dataset 2008.csv was obtained from the [American Statistical Association web-site](http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html), initially sourced by RITA. The dataset represents the data about on-time flight performance for the year of 2008. The size of the dataset is 689,4 MB. The dataset is initially in CSV format including 29 columns and more than 7 million of rows. 

###Databases
3 types of databases have been chosen: relational database (MySQL), document-oriented database (Mongo DB) and key-value store (Redis). 

###Queries
8 different queries were performed. See chapter 3 of the report to find more about the queries.

###Configuration of testing environment
